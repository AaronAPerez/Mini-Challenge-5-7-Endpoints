Project Name: Mini Challenge 5-7 Endpoints <br>
Project Description: Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine: <br> 
  
-You may have multiple controllers inside a Controller folder, or you can have multiple endpoints in a single controller in a Controller folder. <br> 
-Validation is required. If a mathematical endpoint is provided a string or other invalid data, your endpoint should have a response prepared for it. <br> 

<b>Endpoints:</b> <br>
1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values. <br>
   
2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even. <br>
   
3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them. <br>
   For example: <br> 
     - "You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321" <br>
       
4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed. <br>
   For example: <br>
     - "You entered 12345, reversed is 54321" <br>

Comment: All endpoints execute perfectly. I really liked the way your madlib turned out and found the story comical. Your code looks nice and clean. Great job!
